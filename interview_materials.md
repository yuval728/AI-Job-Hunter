To become an AI engineer with no prior experience, you should start by gaining hands-on practice and identifying a use case that would be enjoyable to build and feasible to solve with machine learning. Next, learn different programming languages and tools commonly used in AI development, such as Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and others relevant to your specific interests or industry needs. Additionally, participating in the AI community through forums, hackathons, and open-source projects can help you build connections and gain valuable experience. While many companies require at least a bachelor's degree for entry-level jobs, demonstrating strong skills and interviewing well can still lead to opportunities as an AI engineer.
